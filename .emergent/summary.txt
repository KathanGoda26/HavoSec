<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to make a CoreUI Vue.js admin panel dynamic. The goal is to manage the content of a public-facing website for a cybersecurity company named HavoSec.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Monorepo Structure:** The entire project, including the public website, admin panel, and backend, must be contained within a single repository.
2.  **Dynamic Content:** All content on the public HavoSec website (e.g., hero section text, features, about us, blog posts) must be manageable from the admin panel.
3.  **HavoSec Branding:** The admin panel should be rebranded from the default CoreUI to HavoSec. Logos and colors should remain as they are.
4.  **Backend:** Use a Node.js backend with MongoDB to serve both the admin panel and the public website.
5.  **Admin Panel Features:**
    *   Content Management for all website sections.
    *   Blog Management (full CRUD).
    *   Client Company Management.
    *   Demo Request Management.
    *   Admin User Management.
6.  **Public Website:** A new Vue.js website needs to be built that fetches all its content from the backend API.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project has been restructured into a monorepo with three main directories:
-   : A CoreUI Vue.js admin panel that has been customized for HavoSec. It is connected to the backend and is functional.
-   : A complete Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB integration. It includes JWT authentication and all necessary API endpoints for the admin panel.
-   : A placeholder directory for the public-facing website, which is yet to be built.

Both the backend server and the admin panel frontend are running and have been tested to work together correctly.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent finished building the HavoSec Admin Panel from scratch within the new monorepo structure. It then tested the integration with the backend by starting both services, logging into the admin panel, and verifying that the dashboard displayed correctly.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Build the Integrated HavoSec Application**
    -   **Where to resume:** The backend and admin panel are complete. The next step is to build the public-facing website inside the  directory.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the user's request for a fully integrated application, featuring a dynamic website whose content is managed through the custom admin panel.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Build Public Website Frontend:** Create the Vue.js application in . This includes:
        -   Setting up the basic Vue.js + Vite project.
        -   Creating Pinia stores to fetch content (, , etc.) from the backend API.
        -   Building Vue components for different sections (Header, Footer, Hero, About, Services, Blog).
        -   Creating main views (, , , ) that use the stores to display dynamic content.
    -   **(P1) Implement Public Forms:**
        -   Create the Book a Demo form and connect it to the  backend endpoint.
        -   Create the Contact Us form and connect it to the  backend endpoint.
    -   **(P1) Implement Public Blog:**
        -   Create a blog listing page that fetches and displays all published posts.
        -   Create a blog detail page to view a single post.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   Implement the client-facing login/registration and dashboard on the public website.
    -   Add file upload capabilities in the admin panel for images (e.g., blog post featured images).
    -   Set up production deployment configuration.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Project Restructuring:** Reorganized the repository into a monorepo structure with , , and  directories.
-   **Backend Development ():**
    -   Built a complete Node.js/Express server.
    -   Created MongoDB models for all data entities (Users, Content, Blog, Clients, etc.).
    -   Implemented a full suite of REST APIs with JWT authentication for all admin functionalities.
    -   Created a data seeding script () to populate initial admin user and website content.
-   **Admin Panel Development ():**
    -   Configured the CoreUI Vue.js template to work within the monorepo.
    -   Created Pinia stores (, ) to manage state and API communication.
    -   Developed all required views for dashboard, content management, blog, clients, users, and settings.
    -   Updated the navigation and router to reflect the HavoSec admin structure.
    -   Successfully tested login and dashboard functionality against the live backend.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. A previous issue with Vite's  configuration was related to a development path that was reverted at the user's request and is no longer relevant.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Monorepo Architecture:** Managing multiple related projects (admin, website, backend) in a single repository.
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose), JWT for authentication.
-   **Frontend:** Vue.js 3, Vite, Pinia for state management, CoreUI component library, TailwindCSS.
-   **API:** RESTful API design for serving content and handling admin operations.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main entry point for the backend server, brings together all routes and middleware.
-   : Defines all routes for the admin panel and includes authentication guards.
-   : Manages admin authentication state and login/logout actions.
-   : The UI for editing the public website's content.
-   : Defines the structure of the admin sidebar menu.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  directory is currently a placeholder and needs to be built out completely.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Admin user login.
-   : Fetches aggregated data for the admin dashboard.
-   : Get content for a specific website section.
-   : Update content for a specific website section.
-   : Full CRUD for blog posts.
-   : Full CRUD for client companies.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The user has pivoted once already. The initial approach involved cloning a separate  repository and integrating it. This work was completed but then entirely reverted at the user's request. The current codebase is the result of a **second attempt**, building everything from scratch in a new monorepo structure. You must proceed with the current structure and not refer to the previous, deleted  code. The immediate next step is to build the public website in the  directory.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (Msg 241):**  (This triggered the current monorepo implementation after the previous work was reverted).
2.  **User (Msg 206):**  (This message caused the agent to discard the first implementation attempt).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working:** The backend and admin panel are fully functional and integrated.
-   **To be built:** The public-facing website in  is not yet started.

**3rd Party Integrations**
None.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: None
-   Known regressions: None
